## System Overview

The organvm system is a creative-institutional infrastructure composed of eight specialized organs — each operating as an independent GitHub organization with its own repositories, governance model, and domain focus. Together, they form a coordinated portfolio that spans epistemological theory, generative art, commercial products, orchestration tooling, public scholarship, community spaces, and content distribution.

This is not a monorepo. It is not a corporate org chart. It is an organism — a living system where theory feeds art, art feeds commerce, and the whole is governed by explicit dependency rules that prevent architectural decay. Each organ has a Greek name drawn from its domain's philosophical lineage, and each operates with the autonomy of an independent studio while contributing to the coherence of the whole.

The meta-organvm organization is the umbrella layer: the vantage point from which the entire system becomes legible. It holds no application code. It exists to make the structure navigable and to demonstrate that creative work can be organized with the same rigor applied to distributed systems architecture.

## The Eight Organs

| # | Greek Name | Domain | Organization | Repos | Flagship |
|:-:|:-----------|:-------|:-------------|------:|:---------|
| I | **Theoria** (θεωρία) | Theory | [organvm-i-theoria](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria) | 17 | [recursive-engine--generative-entity](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria/recursive-engine--generative-entity) |
| II | **Poiesis** (ποίησις) | Art | [organvm-ii-poiesis](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis) | 15 | [metasystem-master](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master) |
| III | **Ergon** (ἔργον) | Commerce | [organvm-iii-ergon](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon) | 20 | [public-record-data-scrapper](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon/public-record-data-scrapper) |
| IV | **Taxis** (τάξις) | Orchestration | [organvm-iv-taxis](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis) | 5 | [agentic-titan](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis/agentic-titan) |

| VI | **Koinonia** (κοινωνία) | Community | [organvm-vi-koinonia](https://github.com/organvm-vi-koinonia) | — | *Early development* |
| VII | **Kerygma** (κήρυγμα) | Marketing | [organvm-vii-kerygma](https://github.com/organvm-vii-kerygma) | — | *Early development* |
| VIII | **Meta** (μετά) | Umbrella | [meta-organvm](https://github.com/meta-organvm) | — | *You are here* |

## System Architecture

The eight organs are not peers — they form a directed dependency graph with strict flow constraints.

**The creative pipeline flows in one direction:**

```
Theory (I) → Art (II) → Commerce (III)
```

ORGAN-I produces epistemological frameworks, recursive models, and ontological scaffolding. ORGAN-II consumes those frameworks to build generative art systems, interactive performances, and experiential installations. ORGAN-III packages proven creative work into deployable, revenue-generating products — SaaS platforms, data tools, and browser extensions.

**The governance layer operates orthogonally:**

- **ORGAN-IV (Taxis)** manages cross-organ orchestration: dependency resolution, promotion state machines, and agentic routing infrastructure.
- **ORGAN-V (Logos)** publishes the public process — essays and methodology documents that make the system's construction visible.
- **ORGAN-VI (Koinonia)** provides community infrastructure — reading groups, salon spaces, and collaborative forums.
- **ORGAN-VII (Kerygma)** handles outbound distribution — POSSE syndication, announcements, and audience development.
- **ORGAN-VIII (Meta)** is the umbrella coordination layer — the map of the territory.

No back-edges exist in the dependency graph. Commerce cannot reach back into Art for runtime dependencies; Art cannot reach back into Theory. This constraint is architectural law, not suggestion. It ensures that each layer can evolve independently without creating circular coupling.

## Design Principles

**No back-edges.** The dependency graph flows strictly from theory through art to commerce. Governance organs (IV–VIII) coordinate laterally but never introduce circular dependencies.

**Documentation precedes deployment.** No repository advances to its next phase until its documentation meets the defined quality gate. READMEs are written before features ship, not after.

**Every README is a portfolio piece.** Documentation is written for grant reviewers, hiring managers, and collaborators — not just developers. Each README demonstrates both technical capability and communicative clarity.

**Parallel launch across all organs.** The system launches as a whole, not organ by organ. Every organ is represented from day one, even if some begin as stubs. The architecture is legible at every stage.

**Promotion is a state machine.** Repositories move through defined states — LOCAL, CANDIDATE, PUBLIC_PROCESS, GRADUATED, ARCHIVED — with explicit criteria for each transition. No ad-hoc promotions.

## Current Status

The **Silver Sprint** is complete. All seven organ organizations and the meta umbrella have been documented:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Repositories documented | 58 |
| Total documentation | ~202,000 words |
| Organ organizations live | 8 of 8 |
| Profile READMEs deployed | 8 of 8 |
| Flagship repos (Bronze Sprint) | 5 of 5 |

**Per-organ documentation coverage:**

- **ORGAN-I (Theoria):** 17 repos, ~56,000 words — epistemological frameworks, recursive engines, ontological models
- **ORGAN-II (Poiesis):** 15 repos, ~46,000 words — generative art, interactive performance, metasystem architecture
- **ORGAN-III (Ergon):** 20 repos, ~74,000 words — SaaS products, data scrapers, browser extensions, civic tech
- **ORGAN-IV (Taxis):** 5 repos, ~18,000 words — agentic orchestration, governance routing, system coordination
- **ORGAN-V (Logos):** 1 repo + profile — public process essays and methodology
- **ORGAN-VI (Koinonia):** Profile deployed — community infrastructure in early development
- **ORGAN-VII (Kerygma):** Profile deployed — distribution systems in early development

## Selected Entry Points

- **[metasystem-master](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master)** — The artistic expression. A metasystemic creative engine spanning generative music, interactive theatre, and experiential design. Start here if you care about making things.

- **[public-record-data-scrapper](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon/public-record-data-scrapper)** — The commercial proof. A civic-tech data pipeline that scrapes, normalizes, and serves public records at scale. Start here if you care about shipping products.

- **[agentic-titan](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis/agentic-titan)** — The orchestration layer. An agentic routing and governance system that coordinates work across the entire organ network. Start here if you care about systems architecture.

- **[public-process](https://github.com/organvm-v-logos/public-process)** — The methodology. Essays and reflections on building creative infrastructure in public. Start here if you care about how and why this system exists.

## Portfolio Context

This system exists at the intersection of several disciplines that rarely meet:

- **Systems architecture** — Eight organizations, 58 repositories, explicit dependency graphs, promotion state machines, and governance automation. The infrastructure demonstrates fluency with distributed systems thinking applied to creative production.

- **Creative practice** — Generative art, interactive theatre, recursive epistemology, and metasystemic design. The work is not decorative; it is structurally integrated with the theoretical and commercial layers.

- **Technical execution** — Data pipelines, browser extensions, SaaS platforms, agentic orchestration, and CI/CD automation. The commercial organ alone contains 20 repositories spanning multiple technology stacks.

- **Documentation as craft** — Over 200,000 words of portfolio-grade documentation written to be read by humans, not just parsed by machines. Every README is a demonstration of communicative precision.

The organvm system is a proof of concept for a specific thesis: that creative work, theoretical inquiry, and commercial execution can be coordinated within a single coherent architecture — and that the architecture itself can be made legible, navigable, and beautiful.
